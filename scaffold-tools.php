            <p>The New Big Ben Alloy Induction Level is a premium level with a really outstanding finish and

            <p>As any tradesperson knows, the quality of the job depends not just on their knowledge and skill but
                on using the right tools, and an essential tool for a professional scaffolder is a quality spirit
                level.</p>
            <p>BigBen has been making quality scaffolding tools for decades and they have now designed a level that
                is light, incredibly robust and of course accurate.</p>
